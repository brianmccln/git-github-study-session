        <h1>Git / GitHub Terminal Commands</h1>
        <p>Git is Version Control Software for Tracking Changes</p>

        <h2>Setting up a local Git repository ("repo")</h2>

        <h4>GitHub is a Website where Git "repositories" are stored.</h4>
        <h4>VSCode allows you to do all git/github commands by clicking buttons, but 
            a professional web dev <em>must</em> know the terminal commands for same.
            In fact, prior to Microsoft's aquisition of both GitHub and VSCode, 
            developers <em>had</em> no alternative but to use the terminal for git.</h4>
        <p><b>git init</b> makes a git repo in the current folder (working directory)</p>
        <p><b>ls</b> shows contents of working directory, but does not show hidden items, such as the 
            <b>.git</b> folder, which gets made when you type <b>git init</b></p>
        <p><b>ls -a</b> shows <em>all</em> contents of working directory, including hidden <b>.git</b> folder</p>
        <p><b>ls -R</b> show contents of all files, including those in all subfolders--but not hidden files/folders.</p>
        <p><b>ls -a -R</b> show contents of all files, including hidden file and files in all subfolders</p>
        <p><b>git status</b> shows all staged files (files ready to be committed)</p>
        <p><b>git add file-name.ext</b> adds file-name.ext to staging area, ready to be committed</p>
        <p><b>git add .</b> adds all files/folders to staging area, ready to be committed</p>
        <p><b>git add *</b> does the same as <b>git add .</b>, <em>but</em> without including hidden files or
             folders, which start with a dot.</p>
        <p><b>git rm --cached . -r</b> removes all items from staging area. <b>-r</b> means "recursively", which 
        means that all items in subfolders are also removed. 
        Then type <b>git status</b> to confirm that the files have been unstaged.</p>
        <p><b>git commit -m "first commit"</b> commits the staged files and includes commit message</p>
        <p><b>git log</b> to get details of the commits, including messages and unique id's.</p>
        <p>If you add more files to working directory and type <b>git status</b>, they will appear as untracked.</p>
        <p><b>git checkout notes.txt</b> reverts to the last committed version of <b>notes.txt</b><br>
            This is the ultimate "do over" move for when you irrevocably mess up a file and just want to go
            back to how it was before.</p>

        <h2>Pushing a local git repo to github remote repo</h2>

        <p>These next steps require you to have first logging into github.com, 
            making a new repo there, and copying the url.</p>
        <p><b>git remote add origin https:github.com/MyGithubAcct/MyProjectFolder</b></p>
        <p><b>git branch -M main</b> makes a <b>main</b> branch, providing a destination to push to.</p>
        <p><b>git push -u origin main</b> pushes the local git repo to the remote github repo's <b>main</b> branch.</p>
        <p><b>-u</b> flag creates a tracking reference for every branch that you successfully push onto the remote repository. 
            The local branch you push is automatically linked with the remote branch. This allows you to use commands 
            such as git pull without any arguments.</p>
        <p><b>touch .gitignore</b> makes an invisible file for specifying files for git to ignore. These would be files with sensitive
        information, such as passwords, or <b>.DS_Store</b> file. The file contains information about which files are in the folder 
        and contains options such as what icons look like. For cybersecurity reasons, <b>.DS_Store</b> should <em>not</em> be uploaded to github.</p>
        <p><b>ls -a</b> to see invisible files and folders--including <b>.gitignore</b></p>
        <p><b>open .gitignore</b> to open the .gitignore file for editing in VSCode.</p>
        <p>In <b>.gitignore</b> file, type the names of the file(s) to be ignored by git, one file name per line.</p>
