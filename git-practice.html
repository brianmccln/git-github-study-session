        <h1>Git / GitHub Terminal Commands</h1>
        <h2>Git is Version Control Software for Tracking Changes</h2>
        <h3>GitHub is a Website where Git "repositories" are stored.</h3>
        <h4>VSCode allows you to do all git/github commands by clicking buttons, but 
            a professional web dev <em>must</em> know the terminal commands for same.
            In fact, prior to Microsoft's aquisition of both GitHub and VSCode, 
            developers <em>had</em> no alternative but to use the terminal for git.</h4>
        <p><b>git init</b> makes a git repo in the current folder (working directory)</p>
        <p><b>ls</b> shows contents of working directory, but does not show hidden items, such as the 
            <b>.git</b> folder, which gets made when you type <b>git init</b></p>
        <p><b>ls -s</b> shows <em>all</em> contents of working directory, including hidden <b>.git</b> folder</p>
        <p><b>git status</b> shows all staged files (files ready to be committed)</p>
        <p><b>git add file-name.ext</b> adds file-name.ext to staging area, ready to be committed</p>
        <p><b>git add *</b> adds all files/folders to staging area, ready to be committed</p>
        <p><b>git commit -m "first commit"</b> commits the staged files and includes commit message</p>
        <p><b>git log</b> to get details of the commits, including messages and unique id's.</p>
        <p>If you add more files to working directory and type <b>git status</b>, they will appear as untracked.</p>
        <p><b>git checkout notes.txt</b> reverts to the last committed version of <b>notes.txt</b><br>
            This is the ultimate "do over" move for when you irrevocably mess up a file and just want to go
            back to how it was before.</p>

        <h3>Pushing a Local Git Repo to Remote GitHub Repo</h3>
        <p>These next steps require you to have first logging into github.com, 
            making a new repo there, and copying the url.</p>
        <p><b>git remote add origin https:github.com/MyGithubAcct/MyProjectFolder</b></p>
